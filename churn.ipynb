    "# **Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecom Company**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's competitive market, subscription-based businesses face significant challenges in retaining customers. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers discontinue their subscription services, is a critical metric for these businesses. A high churn rate can significantly impact revenue and growth, making it essential for companies to identify and mitigate factors leading to customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn. By leveraging historical data on customer behavior, demographics, and interactions, we can build a machine learning model that accurately predicts churn. This enables the business to implement targeted retention strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty while reducing the overall churn rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Subscription-based businesses rely heavily on recurring revenue from their customer base. Losing customers not only affects immediate revenue but also increases the cost of acquiring new customers. Therefore, understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn and being able to predict churn is crucial for sustaining long-term growth and profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to predict customer churn for a subscription-based business. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, the business can take proactive measures to retain them, thereby reducing churn rates and improving customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which customers are likely to churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "By predicting the likelihood of churn, the business can focus retention efforts on high-risk customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the key factors contributing to churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these factors helps in refining business strategies and improving customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can the business reduce the churn rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on predictions, the business can design targeted interventions to retain customers."
